# Copilot Instructions for PySD Project

## Critical Rules
1. **ALWAYS read AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md first** - contains domain-specific knowledge
2. **Never modify tests without explicit user approval** - tests represent requirements
3. **ELC validation rule**: ELC can only be used when GRECO exists, references same numbers as OLC
4. **Container validation**: Use `if container is None:` not `if not container:` 
5. **Error messages**: Match existing patterns like "Model validation failed"

## Before Every Task
1. Check AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md for relevant rules
2. Look for TODO comments in code for specifications
3. Run existing tests to understand expected behavior
4. Ask for clarification if requirements are unclear
